HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and applications. HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to define the structure and content of a web document.

HTML documents consist of a series of elements that represent different parts of the web page such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, forms, and more. These elements are marked up using tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). Tags are used to define the start and end of an element, and they can also include attributes to provide additional information about the element.

For example, the following HTML code creates a simple web page with a heading and a paragraph:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `<h1>` tag defines a heading level 1, and the `<p>` tag defines a paragraph. The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

HTML provides a way to structure content, add multimedia elements, create forms for user input, and link to other web pages or external resources. It is the backbone of the web and is used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.
